# audio_visualizer
visualizes audio

---

## TODO
- [x] connect app to spotify (done w/ react & express)
- [x] sign in through website
- [x] sync up to spotify in real-time (or as close as possible)
	- essentially get what user is playing in real time
- [ ] feed audio through visual
	- this will be the hardest part
	- may require refactoring of visual
	- may be possible with severe manipulation of spotify's audio analysis
	- log both outputs for comparison
		- to file?
- [ ] sync visual to music
- [ ] clean up layout
- [ ] find a way to serve full webapp
- [ ] improve base visualizer
- [ ] full control menu
- [ ] choose music from website
- [ ] introduce modifications to visuals
