## TODO
- connect app to spotify
- sign in through website
- reconfigure to take one song at a time directly through site
	- might be the hardest step here
- sync up to spotify in real-time (or as close as possible)
	- essentially get what user is playing in real time
- improve baseline visuals
- introduce modifications to visuals
- full control menu
- choose music from website
